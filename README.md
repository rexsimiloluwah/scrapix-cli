### Description
`Scrapix` is an interactive CLI for scraping and downloading Google images easily. The core of this CLI is the [images-scraper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/images-scraper) package, which uses a puppeteer-based headless browser to automatically search and return the URLs of the images. This `scrapix` CLI can help developers and non-developers to build image datasets for computer vision tasks i.e. image classification, object detection, face recognition. 

### Installation
```bash
$ npm install -g scrapix-cli
```

### To resolve `puppeteer` installation issues on Linux based OS: -
```bash
$ sudo npm install -g scrapix-cli --unsafe-perm=true
```

### Usage 
To start the CLI, Type the `scrapix` command in your CMD or terminal: -
```bash
$ scrapix
```
### Modes
